    <h1>Song of The Mermaids and The Great Escape</h1>
        <p>
             buggers Drew! What have we got ourselves into?”, whispered Willie. He had tears in his eyes, and was trembling with fear. All he could think of now, was how he wished that he had never left home. Drew felt much the same, but tried his best to keep a stiff upper lip. Even though his thoughts were of his Dad and Mum, and the world of worries that he would surely cause them this time.
             <br>
             The storm swiftly approached as the ship turned hard to starboard. Lightening crashed. The wind howled. Sheets of stinging rain beat against the face of sailors that struggled with every task. Waves of water crashed over the deck. Some so big, that the boys thought sure to see the ship broken up and swallowed by the ocean.
            <br>
            Drew turned to Will and asked… “do you still have your knife?” Willie pulled it from his pocket and flicked it open. “Never without,” he replied. Drew peeked over the edge of the boat and watched for a chance to make a break for the yardarm, to free his grandad.
            <br>
            “Alright then, what about this?” said Drew. “We need, a distraction first… a chance to jump down and make our way over to Pop.” Willie’s big eyes were wide with fear. He held the knife up in his cold shaking hand. “B… brilliant. What kind of distraction?” he asked. Drew thought hard for a moment, then snapped his fingers with a great idea. Although, it came to him just a moment too late.
            <br>
            The boys were suddenly yanked up into the air by their tails, and shaken violently about. It was a big ugly bull frog sailor that had them. The one who captured Pop, and rowed them out to the ship.
            <br>
            “Little Shrew stowaways!” he barked. Then he held them up and gazed into their eyes. “I been watching you two from the crow’s-nest. What luck! This makes three in one day. And what’s this you got here?” He was gazing hard at the key dangling from Drew’s neck.
            <br>
            “I’ll take that, if you please,” he said as he snatched the key, breaking the leather string. Just then, an enormous wave crashed into the ship, and broke the top of the forward mast. It smashed against the deck, with sail and rigging whipping in the wind, and was swiftly washed over the side by another sweeping wall of water.
