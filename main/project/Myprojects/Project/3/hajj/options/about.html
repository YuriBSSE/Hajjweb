                       <b> What is Hajj?</b>
                       <br>

                        Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam.  Hajj represents one of the peak experiences in the life of a Muslim. The Hajj or Pilgrimage is made to the sacred places of Islam in and around Mecca. Once in a lifetime every Muslim, man or woman, is expected, unless it is impossible, to make a pilgrimage (a hajj) to Mecca. The pilgrim should perform the duties of Hajj during the sacred month Dhul-Hijjah so as to enter with thousands of others into the annual mass observance of the circumambulation of the Kaa'ba. The Hajj formally begins on the eighth day of Zul-Hijjah - the 12th month of the Muslim lunar calendar.

                        Before performing the Hajj the pilgrims spend the Day of Arafah (ninth day of Zul-Hijjah) in Arafah. Pilgrims commit the entire day to supplication and devotion. In the evening, they move to Muzdalifa. They camp there overnight and offer various prayers. On the tenth day of Zul-Hijjah, they return to Mina and throw seven pebbles at a pillar that symbolizes Satan's temptation of Abraham. The Qur'an describes how Satan tried to persuade Abraham to not ritually murder his son Ishmael, as commanded by God.

                        After performing the duties of Hajj the pilgrims then sacrifice a sheep, and the meat is distributed to friends, relative and the poor. Afterwards, they return to Mecca and perform a final tawaf and sa'i. They symbolize the completion of the Hajj by cutting their hair. Muslims worldwide gather for communal prayers on the first day of (Eid-ul-Adha) the Feast of Sacrifice or Day of Sacrifice. About 2 million Muslims complete the hajj each year. The government of Saudi Arabia has contributed significant resources to maintain the holy places and manage the crowd of pilgrims.

                        <b> Saying of QURAN about Hajj </b>
                        <br>

                        Thus we settled Abraham at the site of the House (the Ka'aba) (saying): 'Do not associate anything with me, and purify my house for those who walk around it, and those who stand there (praying), and those who bow down on their knees in worship.   Proclaim the pilgrimage among mankind: they will come to you on foot and on every lean (beast of burden); let them come from every deep ravine, to bear witness to the advantages they have, and to mention God's name on appointed days."

                        <b>How to Perform Hajj?</b>
                        <br>

                        Dhul Hijjah is the month of Islamic calendar in which the Hajj occurs. Hajj is performed on the 10th of Dhul Hijjah. Hajj is one the five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory to perform Hajj at least once in a lifetime for a Muslim who can physically and financially afford the journey. Performance of Hajj is to please Allah and fulfill its obligation due upon a Muslim. Hajj will not be valid unless the intention is completely pure.

                        Before departing for performing Hajj, one should put on the clothes for ihram.  The pilgrim should hasten to perform umrah before performing Hajj when arrive at in Saudi Arabia. After the umrah is done, the pilgrim can change his clothes back to normal, stitched clothing and live in Makah or its whereabouts until the 8th of Dhul Hijjah. Before performing Hajj most pilgrims spend this time in devotion and worship, offering salah in congregation in the Masjid Al-Haram, and performing supererogatory tawaaf daily. On 8th Dhul Hijjah, this morning signifies the official start of the Hajj. Perform all four salah's of the day inside your tent, in congregation. The day is spent by holding Hajj talks in your tent, helping others, counseling or educating others, or remembering Allah.

                        Just one day before the performance of Hajj on 9th Dhul Hijjah is the day when the pilgrims have to leave for Arafat, after fajr prayer the next day the pilgrims should depart for the plain of Arafat. At Arafat, one should preferably stay inside the tent, offer Dhuhr and ASR salah in joint form behind the imam or on your own. On the day of performing Hajj 10th Dhul Hijjah, after praying Fajr in Muzdalifah, go back to Mina in your bus or on foot. After spending the night in Muzdalifah, those making the Hajj go to Mina where they must spend two days. On the first day, an animal is sacrificed. Many people simply purchase a voucher for the sacrifice of an animal. Part of the animal must be given to the poor. The next day, pilgrims throw the pebbles at three defined stations to metaphorically reject and defeat Satan.

                        After performing Hajj, on 11th Dhul Hijjah spend the day in Mina, going to perform Ramee of all the three Jamraat any time between Dhuhr and sunsets. Tawaaf Ifadaah can also be performed on the 11th. 12th Dhul Hijjah after performing Hajj performs Ramee of the three jamraat any time between Dhuhr and sunset. The 12th of Dhul Hijjah is also the last day that a pilgrim can fulfill the obligation of Tawaaf Ifaadah, before sunset. Spend the night in Mina, and relish this as the last time there, until and unless you perform Hajj again. Once the two days in Mina are finished, pilgrims return to Mecca, where they remove the Ihram and dress in regular clothes. Most men shave their heads and women must cut off an inch of their hair. This completes the Hajj.

                        <b>Things to take on Hajj</b>
                        <br>   

                        The importance of early and adequate preparation of Hajj cannot be over-emphasized. There is a considerable investment of money, time, and physical effort required for the Pilgrimage to be fulfilling and meaningful during the Hajj. Information has to be collected, itineraries must be worked out, and documents have to be readied. You will need certain vaccinations for the issuance of a Hajj visa. Vaccinations should be taken according to the guidelines and requirements for travel to Saudi Arabia for performing hajj.

                        Documentation should be completed before leaving for hajj according to the rules and regulations of Saudi Arabia to avoid any sort of mishap. Great deal of physical effort during Hajj will be required as the constant crush thousands of other pilgrims, trying to perform the same rites at the same time in limited spaces and very hot weather, compounds the demands on the physical conditioning and mental toughness. Proper medications should be taken before leaving for Hajj as gastrointestinal and respiratory infections are very common during Hajj. People from all over the world bring with them all kinds of infections, and the unavoidable closeness of the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims facilitates easy spread of these illnesses.

                        Take enough changes of clothes to make your stay comfortable, but be careful not to overburden yourself with unnecessary clothes. In the hot Saudi Arabian weather, one set of clothes lasts only a day. There is no real need for you to carry items of food with you before leaving for Hajj as everything is readily available in Saudi Arabia at a reasonable cost. Saudi authorities do not allow perishable food items to be brought into the country in significant quantities anyway. Things like multi-blade pocket knife, can opener, nail clipper, small scissors, tooth brush, tooth paste, disposable razors, shaving cream, small mirror, comb, toilet paper, napkins, soap plastic soap dish, small shampoo bottle, deodorant, chap stick, small Vaseline, tooth picks should be carried before leaving for Hajj.
